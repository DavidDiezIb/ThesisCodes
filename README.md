# ThesisCodes
Codes developed for data analysis and plotting for my PhD in Particle Physics (Dark Matter experimental searches: TPC and quantum sensors)
Thesis: "Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers", D.Díez Ibáñez,  University of Zaragoza.

Folders: 
* GasProperties: Drift velocities, attachment, etc., for argon and neon mixtures with isobutane.
* StoppingPowerElectrons: Plotted data from eStar database.
* TREX-DM_GEM: Micromegas + GEM threshold 
* QubitPlots: Different representations of qubit model. Standard Quantum Limit noise level compared with linear amplifiers.
* DarkPhotonExclusionLimits: Single photon counter analysis and its associated exclusion limit computation.
